== HIGH PRIORITY
refactoring + checkstyle

=== maven stuff
jar?
module?

=== Miscellaneous
interactively launch scala and generate test instances
optionally run jobs in parallel on CLI
document program states
run on different sessions to see behavior
cross-verification of Scala and C programs
add more C snippets
include jEdit (or find some other solution? xdg-open?)
timestamp in config

=== FINISHED
move config to a reasonable place (URGENT!!!)
line breaks in help
display purpose description + exit command at startup
more options for yes/no, only check first letter?
"typical value on your system"
remove 8.x
new lines between sections
force restart
"these values were read from the configuration"
improve version displays
auto-open config in system text editor (only "windowed" editors supported for now)
endless loop on Isabelle startup (URGENT!!!)
"successfully verified" instead of "automatically"
improve (E)PL generation message
check Prolog files at version display
more transparent "parsing (E)PL message"
add license (MIT?)
document and rework the (E)PL format (URGENT!!!)
check versions
remove tabs
check lifecycle, add compile or find something more elegant
improve exec:exec section (Is it actually that bad? See first example at https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/examples/example-exec-for-java-programs.html)
do not overwrite framework.pl, or at least ask first!
"general release-readiness" -> see BEAST (Was that everything?)
re-add "?-" or ">" if possible (I still think that this does not work while using exec:exec, using colors for now)
---
empty variables -> not set
remove \n before colour
execute VirageExitJob immediately
rename config.properties
(E)PL keywords caps-lock
generated -> requirement
explain that libswipl.so is a SWI-Prolog library
"isabelle session within it"
explicitly request libjpl.so
check existence of these files
sanitize inputs
scala via isabelle instead of isabelle scala
wider header in help, uniform width
---
branch cleanup
timezone
---
display list of files instead of asking 100 times
add ROOT to path
fixed generation of (E)PL files to tmp
VCLI constructor
---
document
---
check necessity of log messages
fix line breaks, try to add '>' (still seems impossible, but colors removed)
display types instead of Prolog variables in the end
consistency check via keySet instead of version check
resolve synonyms (kind of)
omit anonymous variables and fill automatically
do not display atomic properties
re-enable C generation
add possibility to check all available properties at once
