\<open>Sequential majority comparison compares two alternatives by plurality voting.
The loser gets rejected, and the winner is compared to the next alternative.
This process is repeated until only a single alternative is left, which is
then elected.\<close>

   As all base components are electoral modules (, aggregators, or termination

   sequential majority comparison unsurprisingly is an electoral module.
