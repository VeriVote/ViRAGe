\<open>This is the evaluation function. From a set of currently eligible alternatives,
the evaluation function computes a numerical value that is then to be used for
further (s)election, e.g., by the elimination module.\<close>

   An Evaluation function is Condorcet-rating iff the following holds:
   If a Condorcet Winner w exists, w and only w has the highest value.
