\<open>This is the Borda module used by the Borda rule. The Borda rule is a voting
rule, where on each ballot, each alternative is assigned a score that depends
on how many alternatives are ranked below. The sum of all such scores for an
alternative is hence called their Borda score. The alternative with the highest
Borda score is elected. The module implemented herein only rejects the
alternatives not elected by the voting rule, and defers the alternatives that
would be elected by the full voting rule.\<close>
