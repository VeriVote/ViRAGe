These are randomly generated test instances for the voting rule implementations generated by ViRAGe.
They can be used for both the Scala and C implementations.

The format is as follows:
The file name gives both the number of voters and alternatives, the file XcYv contains a profile with X alternatives and Y voters.
Each line represents a ballot, with alternatives separated by ; and ordered from lowest to highest preference (might be counterintuitive).
