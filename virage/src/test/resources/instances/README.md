These are randomly generated test instances for the voting rule implementations generated by ViRAGe.
They can be used for both the Scala and C implementations.

The file name gives both the number of voters and candidates, the file XcYv contains a profile with X candidates and Y voters.
Each line represents a ballot, with candidates separated by ; and ordered from lowest to highest preference (might be counterintuitive).
