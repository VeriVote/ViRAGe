ViRAGe is a tool for analysis and generation of voting 
rules. It is also capable of generating executable 
implementations of voting rules in Scala. Furthermore, the 
claims about whether some rule satisfies given social 
choice properties is backed by formal composition rules 
within the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and their composition
and the proof for the claim can in many cases be generated 
fully automatically within Isabelle/HOL.

Required Software: 	SWI-Prolog 8.X (A compatibility mode
 			exists for older versions, but using 
			this mode is not recommended, as its 
			stability cannot be guaranteed.)
			JPL (added automatically via maven)
Optional Software: 	Isabelle/HOL
			texlive (for generating the 
			documentation and proofs within 
			Isabelle/HOL)
The SWI-Prolog/JPL setup is not trivial. ViRAGe tries to
give guidance along the way, but in case of further 
problems, please refer to the installation manual at 
https://jpl7.org.

ViRAGe is based on a Compositional Framework theory. When 
invoking ViRAGe, such a framework must be supplied. This can 
be either done via an (E)PL file or via an Isabelle/HOL 
session. When providing an Isabelle/HOL session, ViRAGe is 
able to automatically extract a framework from the given 
session and then generates an (E)PL file for further use and 
modification.

The main user prompt in ViRAGe offers to choose between five 
operations, which can be selected by typing the 
corresponding letter as follows.
	- g	Generate a voting rule satisfying some given
		properties.
	- a	Check whether a given voting rule satisfies 
		some given properties.
	- p 	Generate a proof tree showing that a voting 
		rule satisfies some properties (if it does).
    	- I	Generate an Isabelle/HOL theory file with a 
		formal proof, proving that a voting rule 
		satisfies some properties. This can be 
		checked automatically by ViRAGe.
	- S	Create an executable Scala implementation of 
		a voting rule using the native code 
		generation within Isabelle/HOL.
